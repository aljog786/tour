                   <h2>KOZHIKODE</h2><br>
                   <p>Kozhikode District was the capital of the erstwhile kingdom of the mighty Zamorins and once a renowned commercial center. Today Kozhikode is one of the best cities in Kerala. Endowed with lush green countrysides, serene beaches, historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, rivers, and hills, this city enchants both its inhabitants and its guests.

                   <p>
                    The village of Kallayi is situated on the banks of the river Kallayi. It has an archaic charm and was a busy timber trade centre during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Today, only a few mills exist in the area but the view from the Kallayi Bridge built by the British is a perfect spot to witness a breathtaking sunset.

                      <p>
                        Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city.

                   <p>
                    Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.
                    Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River.
                    The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.
