                      <h4>2.Munnar</h4><br>
                      <p>
                        Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge – Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600m above sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India.
                        Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2018. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m.
                        Anamudi is an ideal spot for trekking.
                        One of the main attractions near Munnar is the Eravikulam National Park.
