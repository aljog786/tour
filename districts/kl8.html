                      <p>
                        A beautiful viewpoint at just an hour’s drive from the city, Cheppara is probably the least known of all of Thrissur Tourist Places. The word ‘Para’ means hill, and that is exactly what this place is.

Spread in an area of about 1 km, visitors claim that the views from the top of the hill are magnetic and captivating, and because it is less known, one can expect the least amount of crowd at any given time. The highlight of this spot, however, is the amazing view of the sunset.
